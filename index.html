    I really wanted to use a lot of my programs AS my notes,
    so if anyone ends up reading this just know there will be a
    LOT of comments.

    First note, I don't fully understand why this is called an
    index file? I assume an index is as it sounds, but for now
    the naming convention doesn't really have a connection to
    anything I understand. Ask about this later.

    Also, apparently, HTML uses a set of reconized commands known
    as 'tags', which almost all of the code below will use. I don't
    know how they compare to functions or keywords though. This first
    one is the DOCTYPE tag, and it talks to the browser to tell
    it what we're using. In this case, HTML5. -->
<html>
<!--
    Here, we put down an html tag to let the browser know that this is
    where the HTML begins, which is pretty scary because that kind of
    implies that webpages can be made of several different languages at
    once. -->

<head>
    <!-- From the video: "This is where you store all of the
    information and imports for the page. -->
    <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- This tag sets the characters to be used in the page-->
    <title>\o/ Demo Project \o/</title> <!-- This is the description on the tab in a browser -->
</head>
<body> <!-- This is the content of the page itself. -->

    <h1>My First Website</h1> <!-- h1 up to h6 are headings. This is not enumnerated, it's a style -->
    <p> This is <strong>technically</strong> the second website I've made. That's not what the little tutorial told me to write, though. But this <em>will</em> teach me a number of basics about using HTML.</p>

    <!-- p creates a new paragraph. Generally used to denote blocks of text.
     The additional tags such as strong and em are called In-Line tags, and modify that text-->

    <div> <!-- Informs the browser that there needs to be a gap here -->
        <h2>HTML Learning Goals</h2> <!-- Again h2 to is a style and not the second heading-->
        <ul> <!-- ul and ol are unordered and ordered lists respectively -->
            <li>Page Structure</li> <!-- each list tag, li, denotes a bullet -->
            <li>Element Attributes</li>
            <li>Tag Types</li>
            <li>Linking in Other Resources</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div> <!-- Indentation in this case is a measure of opening and closing new tags -->
        <h2>CSS Learning Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What Properties Are</li>
            <li>How to use Elements, and Element Attributes to change Styles</li>

    <!-- I have a specific question I need to remember. The video
     mentions that I should be able to just open this file in a web browser,
     but I can't do that without deploying it first. Is that correct?
     I feel like I should be able to run my code without deployment.-->
